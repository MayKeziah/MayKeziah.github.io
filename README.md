## About Me
I'm a software engineer located in the greater Seattle area of Washington. I earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Software Engineering at the University of Washington Bothell in June 2021. 

What am I learning today:
 - Usability Engineering
 - User-Centered Design
 - Game Development

Recent projects:
 - Battleship: a client-server 2-player battleship game developed in Python with persistant user data.
 - [SQLiteTestClient](https://github.com/MayKeziah/SQLiteTestClient): a test script written in Python to perform unit tests on a SQLite database.
 - Dissassembler: a program written in assembly that takes binary from memory and converts it into assembly code.
