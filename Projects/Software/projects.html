						<h3>Leet Programming Online Course by T4G (2,084+ lines of code)</h3>
						<p>
							<span class="image left"><img src="./../../images/stepik.png" alt="" />
							</span>
							<h4>C++ | Stepik | June 2020 - Present</h4>
							Leet Programming is a free online course meant to help
								software engineers prepare for technical interviews. 
								It takes problems from 
								<a href="https://leetcode.com">leetcode</a> and provides 
								solutions and explanations. The goal is to help learners
								not only see solutions to a problem, but to understand those
								solutions. I have contributed more than 27 lessons and taught 8 live workshops.

						<!-- <h3>Technical Interview Prep: Beginner Workshop Track</h3>
						<p>
							<span class="image left"><img src="images/TIP_Beginners.png" alt="" />
							</span>
							<h4>C++ | December 2020 - Present</h4>
								Technical Interview Prep (TIP) is a workshop series (previously CTCI) presented by the 
								UWB ACM. In December 2020, I proposed a new workshop concept
								to help students earlier in the program succeed by teaching extensions to what they learn in class,
								and creating competitive events to help them to practice. I created a catalog of lesson plans to match
								each topic in the early CS curriculum. Each lesson took a topic students were learning, and demonstrated
								how to approach technical interview questions that use that concept. Each lesson is also paired with a 
								UWB ACM competitive programming event.

						<h3>Merge Reinforcement Learning Algorithm into Pacman Game (505 lines of code)</h3>
						<p>
							<span class="image left"><img src="./../../images/pacman.png" alt="" />
							</span>
							<h4>Python | January - March 2021 </h4>
							Forking an existing pacman program, I merged AI algorithms into the implementation
							allowing pacman and ghosts to play intelligently. Peak performance included 
							reinforcement learning. </br>
							<strong>Implemented & successfully merged algorithms include: </strong> 
							Breadth-first search, depth-first search, uniform-cost search, A* search, Minimax, 
							expectimax, value iteration (online and prioritized offline), and Q-learning 
							(epsilon greedy, approximate).

						<h3>Concert Ticket Database by The Quarter Notes</h3>
						<p>
							<span class="image left"><img src="./../../images/rdm.png" alt="" />
							</span>
							<h4>Python | SQLite | January - March 2021 </h4>
							Ticket Market is a database implemented to store information about box office
							and peer-to-peer concert ticket sales. The project included design documentation, 
							create files, insert files, select files (to demonstrate functionality), a basic 
							GUI, and a test file for quality assurance. </br>
							<strong>Functionality includes: </strong> 
							List all 3rd party sellers that price general admission tickets for a show under a given cost,
							list all upcoming shows for a particular venue that occur on specific days during the year, 
							list all events in the upcoming year at a specific venue that are multiple day events, and 
							many more.

								<h4>Python | SQLite | March 2021 </h4>
								Try out my test script for SQLite databases. All you have to do is head over to the 
								repository, clone it, follow the installation instructions, and you can easily test your
								database and automate a number of tasks. </br>
								<strong>Features include: </strong> automated dropping of all tables 
								in the database, creating tables defined in specified files, populating tables from insert files,
								querying the database from select files, and running/error checking a sql file.

								<h4>Python | Pickle | September - December 2020</h4>
                Battleship by Dox is a client-server game written in python. User information including score
								records, username, and password are persistant due to pickle serialization. My responsibilities included design,
								front-end development, back-end graphics utilities, defining an interface for the 
								client program, and creating a video demo of the gameplay and features. The graphics were all 
								created using John Zelle's <a href="https://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/">graphics.py</a> library.

							<h3>Disasembler from Binary to Assembly by dreamteam (503 lines of code)</h3>
                <p><span class="image left"><img src="./../../images/disassembler3.png" alt="" />
                </span>
								<h4>Assembly | Easy68k | September - December 2020</h4>
                Designed and implemented a disassembler program in assembly. The program waited for 
								the user to specify a start and end position in memory. Then, it read the binary from 
								the start to the end position and converted it to assembly code. The assembly equivalent was
								displayed to the console for the user, and the program looped back to waiting for input until 
								the user quit the program. My responsibilities included designing the interfaces between
								each program module, decoding and printing all opcode words, decoding and printing all size codes,
								and creating a powerpoint presentation.
