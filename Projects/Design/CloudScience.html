            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
              NASA scientists study clouds to understand weather and learn how it affects the world. 
              Their instruments read weather information from satallites. 
              From that perspective, it is challenging to decern the different types of clouds in an area
              and it is hard to tell what is snow and what is cloud. 
              To gather meaningful cloud data, they require images from the ground to compare to their readings.
            </p>
            <p> 
              Currently, NASA relies on observations gathered on the GLOBE Observer application.
              This application is well designed for recording observations, but it does not cater to other use-cases and scenarios.
              For this project, we designed and prototyped a mobile application that would allow observations to be collected
              but would also draw users back to the application through features that catered to the main personas we identified.
            </p>

            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>
              To understand how to design this application, we explored how users interact with 
              existing software, how they would use the application, and what features would be most 
              attractive to them. We identified 4 main personas: scientists, children/youth, teachers, 
              and everyday people interested in citizen science. 
              </p>
              <p>
                To derive minimum viable product requirements, we conducted a survey of 33 potential users. 
                <span class="image right"><img src="./../../images/context.png" alt="" /></span>
                We were surprised to discover that 27.3% said they would use this application in a class assignment
                and 3% said they would use it to homeschool children. 
                This showed the need for teachers, parent-educators, and students to be acknowledged as 
                primary users for this application. 
              </p>
              <p>
                One survey participant explained that they lived between foothill mountains. 
                That meant that often when they were out on a walk in their neighborhood, they did not have cell service.
                For that reason, they explained that the application would need to be able to use stored photos for observations
                for them to be able to use it. Then, they could record images on their walk, return home, and use their home
                WiFi to submit their photos. This showed another important scenario: people who want to participate without 
                cell service or mobile data. 
              </p>

              <h3>Persona</h3>
              <p>
                <span class="image right"><img src="./../../images/My Post.png" alt="" /></span>
                The design process consisted of using existing technologies and user research to plan the 
                development of our app. The persona I focused on was a 10 year old girl who uses the app for school.
                
              </p>
              <p>
                To assist in understanding the wants of such a user, I explored the preferred apps of young
                girls that I know personally and tried to find what makes them fun and engaging to determine the 
                key features to include for the persona. I determined that the young girls I know like to be challenged 
                much like they feel challenged in a game. They like puzzles and the acheivement that comes with solving them.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also wanted to understand the context that this persona might be in when they use the app. I created a 
                storyboard to help me visualise the user as I developed the app. In this story, I imagined that the 
                girl would be at school, outside, participating in a class activity with her peers. This got me thinking 
                about her teacher. In this scenario, the teacher is the one facilitating and supervising her experience. 
                Thus, to design for the young girl, I also needed to design for her teacher or homeschooling parent to
                support them in the young girl's experience. 
              </p>

              <h3>Journey Map</h3>
              For the journey map, I completed the testing phase column of Sam's journey. <br>

              <h3>Prototypes</h3>
              <p>
                The prototype is split into two scenarios. In the first scenario, an expert scientist user registers for an account 
                and completes an observation of the climate. In the second scenario, a grade school student completes a lesson 
                during an in class activity. My portion of the prototype includes the path from the home page to the page allowing 
                users to start lesson 2.
