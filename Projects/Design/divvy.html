            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
              In the remote environment initiated by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, students rely on remote 
              collaboration tools more than ever. In an effort to understand the needs of students who 
              are working on projects in a team, we designed, prototyped, and tested an application 
              for remote project management.
            </p>

            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>
              To understand how to design this application, we explored how users interact with 
              existing software, how they would use the application, and what features would be most 
              attractive to them. We identified 4 main personas: students (of two different age groups), 
              professors, and student managers (students who manage their team). To accomodate the time 
              constraints on this project, we focused our time primarily on the student manager persona.
            </p>
            <h4>Ethnographic Research</h4>
            <p>
              Early in our design process, we studied the way people work in teams remotely. Since this project 
              was completed during the COVID-19 pandemic, we used an experimental approach to ethnographic research 
              which involved searching the internet for user reviews and user stories. Then, we combined our findings 
              into a single document and used card sorting to determine patterns in our data. Five patterns emerged:
              <ol>
                <li>Remote learning and teamwork</li>
                <li>Online collaboration</li>
                <li>Project management</li>
                <li>Communication</li>
                <li>Customization</li>
              </ol>
              With these categories discovered, our team created our 
              <a href="Ethnographic Research Online Scavenger Hunt.pdf">Ethnographic Research</a> presentation to explain to 
              our peers what we had learned about our problem area.
            </p>
            <h4>User Interviews</h4>
            <p>
              To derive minimum viable product requirements, we interviewed 6 university students about their 
              experience with remote collaboration. 
              We wanted to answer a number of general research questions with these interviews:
              <ul>
                <li>What experience does this user have with remote projects?</li>
                <li>What tasks, technologies, and devices are involved in the user's remote projects?</li>
                <li>How does the user like to communicate with their team? 
                  What technologies for communication are a must?</li>
                <li>How does the user share and collaborate on work with their team?</li>
                <li>What methods of task management are most important to the user?</li>
                <li>What frustrates/delights the user about completing group projects with existing technology?</li>
              </ul>
              Upon completion of our interviews, we synthesised our notes into a list of requirements from the user we interviewed. 
              Then, we came together as a group and decided on the priority of each requirement. This became our <a href="Requirements_Specification.pdf">Requirement Specification</a> document. 
            </p>
            <h4>Inspiration Search</h4>
            <p>
            After determining the exisiting technologies that were most commonly used by our interview 
            participants, we set out to understand those tools and what aspects of them should be used as 
            inspiration to our design. Each member of the team chose a different tool and completed an analysis of it. 
            the results were then presented at our next meeting. The results of this activity became our 
            <a href="Competitive and Inspirational Alternatives.pdf">Completitive and Inspirational Alternatives</a> 
            document.
            </p> 
            <h4>UI Sketching</h4>
            <p>
            Once we had decided on our minimum viable product, learned about the needs of our target
            users, and identified existing software for UI and functionality inspiration, we were ready to 
            start sketching our ideas for the UI. In this stage, we took a non-traditional approach to 
            storyboarding that involved writing a user story and showing sketches of what the UI might do. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Each team member created their own UI storyboard. We then came together as a team to talk about 
              what we liked from each example and created a synthesised storyboard. This became our 
              <a href="Storyboard Exercise Uninitialized Local Team.pdf">Storyboard Exercise</a> document.
            </p>

            <h4>Prototype Usability Study</h4>
            <p>
            Using our synthesised UI storyboard, we designed a prototype that could support the minimum required 
            functionality for our application. We used it to complete a usability study with 6 participants. We then 
            presented our findings to each other at our weekly meeting and used those findings to prioritize modifications 
            that must be implemented in our final prototype. This became our
            <a href="Usability Testing (1).pdf">Usability Testing</a>  document.
            </p>
             
            
            <h3>Final Deliverables</h3>
            At the completion of this project, our team had three deliverables, a 
            <a href="Final Design Readout.pdf">presentation</a> , a 
            <a href="Final Design.pdf">report</a> , and a 
            <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/11Vz8KkjLnnWuoAtxtpQNk/DarkTheme_CSS480-(Copy)?node-id=208%3A675&scaling=contain">prototype</a> .
